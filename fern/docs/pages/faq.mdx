## Why does the API have different models for Create and Retrieve?

The ProjectManager API provides customized data models for each type of API. This allows the API to expose only the fields that are relevant for each specific action.

As an example, some fields like `ShortCode` are assigned by the ProjectManager system. These fields are not available on the Create or Update models, but they appear on the Retrieve and Query models.
