Don't want to write all the REST API code yourself? Why not use an MIT-licensed open source ProjectManager.com  software development kit in your favorite language?

## Why use a SDK?

The ProjectManager.com REST API v4 is very easy to use.  Most programming languages provide tools to easily call REST APIs with little extra work. But if you use a ProjectManager software development kit, you get more:

- Save yourself time and effort by using pre-written integrations
- Get notifications whenever a new release of the API is available
- Easily find the API you want using autocomplete in your favorite IDE
- See all the documentation from this website by hovering over an API call or data model

So if you'd like to try out a ProjectManager SDK, read on.
