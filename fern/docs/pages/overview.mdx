Your team can get started with the ProjectManager API right away - here's how.

1. All ProjectManager.com workspaces have access to the API. If you don't have a workspace, [create a free trial now!](https://www.projectmanager.com/freetrial?edition=d)

2. Once you have signed up for an account, any users with the `Admin` or `Global Admin` roles within your workspace can [create an API key](https://developer.projectmanager.com/getting-started/authentication) within ProjectManager. Remember to save your API key in your company's secure credential storage system!

3. Download the appropriate software development kit for your favorite programming language:

## Using the API

All API calls to ProjectManager.com use the URL `https://api.projectmanager.com/` regardless of your workspace's custom URL.  You must use a bearer token to contact the API.

The ProjectManager.com API allows you to synchronize data from other systems to your project files and data. With the ProjectManager.com API, you can:

- Notify your accounting system when a task is completed, so they can send an invoice to the customer
- Import data from your internal IT systems into tasks
- Run a security scan on your software and automatically create a task for each risk
- Automatically synchronize comments to tasks

## Common use cases

The ProjectManager API provides lots of features that you can use to help automate your day-to-day processes. One good way to get started is to look at the most commonly used APIs such as these:

- [Create a new Project](https://developer.projectmanager.com/api-reference/project/create-project)
- [Query for Tasks within a Project](https://developer.projectmanager.com/api-reference/task/query-tasks)
- [Create a Comment on a Task](https://developer.projectmanager.com/api-reference/discussion/create-task-comment)
- [Update a Custom Column on a Task](https://developer.projectmanager.com/api-reference/task-field/update-task-field-value)
