## Using the API

The ProjectManager.com API allows you to synchronize data from other systems to your project files and data. Some ideas for integrations include:

- Notify your accounting system when a task is completed, so they can send an invoice to the customer
- Import data from your internal IT systems into tasks
- Run a security scan on your software and automatically create a task for each risk
- Automatically synchronize comments to tasks

The ProjectManager API provides lots of features that you can use to help automate your day-to-day processes. One good way to get started is to look at the most commonly used APIs such as these:

- [Create a new Project](https://softwaredeveloper.projectmanager.com/v4/reference/post_api-data-projects)
- [Query for Tasks within a Project](https://softwaredeveloper.projectmanager.com/v4/reference/get_api-data-tasks)
- [Create a Comment on a Task](https://softwaredeveloper.projectmanager.com/v4/reference/post_api-data-tasks-taskid-discussions)
- [Update a Custom Column on a Task](https://softwaredeveloper.projectmanager.com/v4/reference/put_api-data-tasks-taskid-fields-fieldid)
