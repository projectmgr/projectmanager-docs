When you use the ProjectManager v4 API, you can search for your information using the query language [OData](https://www.odata.org/). All data types within ProjectManager can be retrieved using OData queries.

So let's break this down - what is an OData query? It is a type of query that allows you to:

- **Filter** records based on criteria you specify in the `$filter` parameter.
- **Paginate** your results using `$top` and `$skip`.
- **Sort** your query results using `$orderby`.
- **Fetch** additional data using `$expand`.
- **Reduce** unwanted data using `$select`.

Let's walk through the basics for an OData query.

## Filtering records using OData

Whenever you want to find a specific record in the ProjectManager system, you can use an OData filter statement to search. Microsoft provides a nice tutorial page on [learning OData filter expressions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-nav/using-filter-expressions-in-odata-uris) which goes into more detail, but let's summarize it here.

- Search for projects with a specific where a field value matches using an `$filter={field-name} eq {value}` statement, like `$filter=shortCode eq MyNewProject`
- Search for tasks more recent than a specific time using an `$filter={field-name} gt {date}` statement, like `$filter=createDate gt 2023-03-01`
- Search for a resource with a comment in its "notes" field using an `$filter=substringof({field-name}, '{substring}')` statement, like `$filter=substringof(notes, 'test')`.

## Comparators and Functions within OData filtering 

| Name                 | Example                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Equals               | `{field} eq {value}`             |
| Greater Than         | `{field} gt {value}`             |
| Greater Than Or Equal| `{field} ge {value}`             |
| Less Than            | `{field} lt {value}`             |
| Less Than Or Equal   | `{field} le {value}`             |
| Not Equal            | `{field} ne {value}`             |
| Contains             | `substringof({field}, {value})`  |
| Starts With          | `startswith({field}, {value})`   |
| Ends With            | `endswith({field}, {value})`     |

### Filtering tips

When specifying values in your query, keep in mind these things:

- Numeric values are presented as-is, for example `count eq 7`
- String values are enclosed in single quotes, for example `name eq 'Bob Smith'`
- Date values are always written in [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format, also known as YYYY-MM-DD. For example, `createDate gt 2023-01-01`

## Pagination using OData

The standard for OData pagination uses the concept of **top** and **skip**. Here's how it works.

1. The server begins to produce a list of all records matching your $filter statement in the order specified by the $orderby parameter.

2. The server will omit the number of records specified by the $skip parameter, if it is present.

3. If there are still more records remaining after the $skip parameter has been exhausted, the server will begin delivering records up until the $top value is reached.

This allows you to paginate records easily. If you want to retrieve the top 50 records in a table, you specify `$top=50`. To retrieve the second page of results, specify `$skip=50` and `$top=50`.

## Expanding data

Some OData query endpoints allow you to fetch additional data using the `$expand` parameter. The documentation for the API will explain what options are available and how to use them on each endpoint.
