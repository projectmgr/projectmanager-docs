The ProjectManager API v3 was deprecated in 2023 but continues to be available for customers who have running code.  

Developers actively building applications on API v3 are encouraged to upgrade to REST v4.

### Upgrading from API v3 to API v4

Developers using API v3 can begin using REST API v4 immediately.  Here's how to get started:

* Create a [REST API v4 API key](../getting-started/authentication) for your workspace
* Download one of the [ProjectManager SDKs](../getting-started/sdks) for your favorite programming language
* Begin writing code using the V4 APIs or [example code](https://github.com/projectmgr/projectmanager-sdk-examples)
* Submit questions and comments on our [issues board](https://github.com/projectmgr/projectmanager-docs/issues)
