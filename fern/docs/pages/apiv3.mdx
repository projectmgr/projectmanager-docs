The ProjectManager API v3 was deprecated in 2023.  Users of ProjectManager API v3 are encouraged to upgrade to REST v4.

### Upgrading from API v3 to API v4

Developers using API v3 can begin using REST API v4 immediately.  Here's how to get started:

* Create a [REST API v4 API key](../getting-started/authentication) for your workspace
* Download one of the [ProjectManager SDKs](../getting-started/sdks) for your favorite programming language
