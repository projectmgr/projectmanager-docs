The ProjectManager REST API uses API keys generated from within the ProjectManager application.

## Contacting the API

The ProjectManager API is available at https://api.projectmanager.com.  This web page shows the current version number of the API and allows you to review the latest Swagger/OpenAPI files.

You can either use OAuth tokens (for interactive applications) or API keys (for unattended applications) to contact the ProjectManager API.  All `Admin` and `Global Admin` level users within your workspace are permitted to create API keys.  Users with more limited roles will not be able to create API keys.

Credentials are sent to the API using the Authorization header as follows:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Generating an API key

To create an API key to begin using the ProjectManager API, follow these steps:

1. API keys are tied to workspaces, and are available to admins and global admins only.
2. Click on your name in the bottom left hand corner, then select "Integrations". 
3. On the "Integrations" popup, select the "API Keys" tab on the bottom left hand side. 
4. Select the API section and click "Create API Key". 
5. Give your API key a name that you can use to remember it. 
6. Click "Generate Tokens" then copy and save your API key.
7. We recommend rotating API keys - follow your organizationâ€™s key rotation policy.

## Using the SDK to authenticate

If you use a ProjectManager SDK, provide your token credentials using the `WithBearerToken` method as follows:

<CodeBlocks>
    <CodeBlock title="C#">
    ```csharp
    return ProjectManagerClient
        .WithCustomEnvironment(env)
        .WithBearerToken(apiKey);
    ```
    </CodeBlock>
    <CodeBlock title="Python">
    ```python
    client = ProjectManagerClient()
    client = client.with_custom_environment(env)
    client = client.with_bearer_token(api_key)
    ```
    </CodeBlock>
    <CodeBlock title="Java">
    ```java
    ProjectManagerClient client = new ProjectManagerClient()
        .withCustomEnvironment(env)
        .withBearerToken(apiKey);
    ```
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeBlocks>

The value provided to `WithCustomEnvironment` should be `api.projectmanager.com`.
The value provided to `WithBearerToken` should be the API key you generated.
